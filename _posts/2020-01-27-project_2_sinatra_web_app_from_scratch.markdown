I really can't believe I've made it this far, but here I am! The past 3 weeks have been hectic, stressful, busy, frustrating, yet so relieving and rewarding. Just like my first project, I always seem to learn and understand the material far more than when I'm just doing labs during the cohort. Projects are dreadful but its really what's been building me and modling me into the great future software developer I seemyself becoming. So for this project, we had to build FROM SCRATCH a ruby web app using Sinatra. We chose our theme or the idea for the project, which is always so hard for me just because I like to chose something I'd actually want to work on or create in the future. Then I create a database(db), created tables, rows, columns..etc. Everything I've learned since day one was applied and used, from building methods, associations, establishing relationships bewteen objects or models, to writing html. The best part is being stuck and realizing you misspelled a word or tried to call a GET request out of the ENTIRE CLASS!! Shout out to my old cohort lead Juan for catching that for me LOL! If you want to take a look at my project go ahead and take a look. https://github.com/cervantesjess1994/LashCollection I actually plan on working on this on the side. Don't judge!!! I didn't do much on the styling as you can see, but that will be in the works!!!
