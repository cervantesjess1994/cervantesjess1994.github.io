CLI gem project to be exact. Honestly, I feel like I learned SO much from building this fromscratch than any other lesson. Getting started was so hard  for me. You know those times where you're kind of scared so you just keep procrastinating? OMG it's the worst idea though. Had to get it together. So, for ME, the hardest part of this project was the API. I had to watch so many videos on how to do them, so much research I did on my own, and when I finally got it down I was so happy! I wasn't creative at all with my idea(had to do with food) , but to make is as simple as possible I decided to narrow it down to my hometown. Anyway, my CLI takes an API from yelp that they provide, by running my gem it will provide a list of the 20 best food places in my home town, Palo Alto, California. You choose the foodplace by entering a number and then it will provide you with the basic info such as the food place's address, phone number, and a link to their website. Sounds very simple but I was so proud and happy when I got it tofinally work. Everything else was easy. Create your classes, start making methods, iterate, etc. But in the end this was so fun!
