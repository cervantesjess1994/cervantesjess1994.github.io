Second blog post, I should have began at week 1 BUT better late than never.
So week 7, wow! Feels like just yesterday I learned what coding is! Well, I've learned the basics of Ruby so far, such as defining methods, booleans, arrays, hashes, etc. Currently in OOP, metaprogramming. I've learned to be patient with myself since sometimes its just so much new information thrown at me at once. I got this!! So far I'm loving inheritance and modules.... well back to coding. I'll keep you posted for week 8, it'll be project week!!!!
