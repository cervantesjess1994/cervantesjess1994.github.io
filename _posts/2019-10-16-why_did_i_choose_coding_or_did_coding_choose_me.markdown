Long story short, it was destiny.  No, I mean yes, but basically I was introduced by the cofounder of Career Karma( I suggest you look them up). Ruben messaged me and asked if I wanted to break into tech, I said HELL YES!! He then gave me a run down about what coding is and I did my own research, so I decided why not just try. Fast forward a couple months, after trying numerous pre-courses, I got accepted and I am currently enrolled at Flatiron school! I am doing the online part-time software cohort and I'm loving it! Yes, it gets hard, but that just means we are learning. I've shed a few tears and been frustrated af but, I learned to not stress so much and to ask for help. I will get there, so take a deep breath, and just code! I would have never thought I would be coding right now... with no computer science degree or any coding background at all.
